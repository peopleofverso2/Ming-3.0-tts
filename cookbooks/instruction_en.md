# Ming-3.0-tts-0.5b Control Reference

English | [简体中文](instructions.md)

Every value accepted by the `controls`, `language_id` and inline-tag inputs of
`MingTTS.synthesize`. Sections marked **new** did not exist in the previous
release.

## <a id="paralinguistic-tags-new"></a>Paralinguistic tags **new**

Written inline in the text, in either Chinese or English, anywhere in the
sentence. They are routed around text normalization, so they reach the model
unchanged. Tags are case-sensitive and must include the brackets.

| Tag | Effect |
| :--- | :--- |
| `[Breathing]` | audible breath |
| `[Cough]` | cough |
| `[Sigh]` | sigh |
| `[Laughter]` | laughter |
| `[Uhm]` | hesitation filler |
| `[Surprise-ah]` | surprised "ah" |
| `[Surprise-oh]` | surprised "oh" |
| `[Dissatisfaction-hnn]` | disgruntled "hnn" |
| `[Confirmation-en]` | affirming "en" |
| `[Question-ei]` | questioning "ei" |
| `[Question-ah]` | questioning "ah" |
| `[Question-en]` | questioning "en" |
| `[Question-oh]` | questioning "oh" |
| `[Question-huh]` | questioning "huh" |

## <a id="target-languages-new"></a>Target languages **new**

Passed as `language_id`. Chinese and English work without it; the other five
require it, because it both adds the target-language line to the prompt and
keeps the text away from the Chinese/English normalizer.

| `language_id` | Language |
| :--- | :--- |
| `zh` | Chinese |
| `en` | English |
| `ja` | Japanese |
| `ko` | Korean |
| `de` | German |
| `fr` | French |
| `es` | Spanish |

The voice is carried by the reference recording, not the language, so a
Chinese reference can speak any of these.

Dialects are not selected here; see the `dialect` control below.

## <a id="freeform"></a>Freeform control

Pass a natural-language delivery instruction through `instruction` to guide tone, pacing, emphasis or speaking style. Put only the words to synthesize in `text`; do not prepend the instruction to the spoken text. Reference audio is not required and is not recommended by default. Do not combine Freeform with voice design, built-in voices, emotion, dialect or basic attribute controls.

The instructions below are preserved exactly as used, including the Chinese inputs. Scenario labels are explanatory and are not model parameters.

| Scenario | Instruction (`instruction`) |
| :--- | :--- |
| English: encouraging sports coach | Sound like an encouraging sports coach, energetic and firm without shouting. |
| Chinese: gentle bedtime story | 用温柔、舒缓的声音讲述睡前故事，像在轻声安慰孩子。 |
| English: warm storytelling | Speak in a warm, intimate storytelling voice, unhurried. |

The examples assume the model has been loaded as described in the README. The synthesis texts are illustrative.

### English sports coach (0.5B)

```python
model.synthesize(
    task="FREEFORM",
    text="Keep your eyes forward and your shoulders relaxed. One more round—you can do this!",
    instruction="Sound like an encouraging sports coach, energetic and firm without shouting.",
    use_zero_spk_emb=True,
)
```

### English warm storytelling (0.5B)

```python
model.synthesize(
    task="FREEFORM",
    text="The old radio crackled softly as the storm moved across the valley.",
    instruction="Speak in a warm, intimate storytelling voice, unhurried.",
    use_zero_spk_emb=True,
)
```

### Chinese bedtime story (Tiny)

Omit `prompt_wav` and `prompt_text`.

```python
tts.generate(
    task="freeform",
    text="小熊轻轻闭上眼睛，月亮替它盖好了一床银色的被子。",
    instruction="用温柔、舒缓的声音讲述睡前故事，像在轻声安慰孩子。",
)
```
